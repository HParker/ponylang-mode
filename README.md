# ponylang-mode: An emacs mode for editing Pony code

*"Pony is an object-oriented, actor-model, capabilities-secure, high
performance programming language."*

`ponylang-mode` is an Emacs mode for editing Pony code.

Right now the mode is very new and immature. This is my first time
writing an editing mode, so it probably has all sorts of issues. Let
me know, provide patches, etc...I'm very happy to accept
contributions and feedback!
